nextboat is an open-source WSDOT ferry app that I originally created for myself a while back (as a bicycle commuting on the Bainbridge Island/Seattle boat). And now I want to share it with my fellow ferry commuters. ;)

nextboat was/is heavily influenced by WSDOT, Next Manly Ferry, Ferry Flee and Next Manly Ferry.
